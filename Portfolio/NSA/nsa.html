<h6>PROTO PERSONA</h6>

 <p>
    We initiated our design process by creating a prototype persona, whom we named Josh. Josh, a 15-year-old student, is in the midst of crafting a school paper and simultaneously exploring the possibility of pursuing a career in cybersecurity. This proto persona serves as our guiding compass, embodying the diverse needs and aspirations of our user base, and informs our design decisions as we endeavor to create a user-friendly and engaging experience tailored to Josh's goals and challenges.
 </p>
 <h6>USER PATH</h6>
 <p>After defining a Proto Persona, we agreed that our users are gonna be students between elementary school and high school. This is some if the reason why we think theyâ€™ll be interested in visit the NSA website:
    <li>School research project: Students could be working on a school project related to national security or intelligence agencies and is visiting the NSA website to gather information</li>
    <br>
    <li>Personal interest: Students might have a personal interest in national security and intelligence activities and is visiting the NSA website to learn more about the agency's history, mission, and current activities</li>

    <h6> HEURISTIC EVALUATION</h6>
    <p> A heuristic evaluation is a structured and methodical approach to assessing the usability and effectiveness of a digital interface or system. It involves the examination of a product by usability experts, who utilize a set of established usability principles or heuristics to identify potential issues and areas for improvement. This evaluation method plays a crucial role in ensuring that user interfaces meet high standards of usability, efficiency, and user satisfaction, ultimately leading to an enhanced user experience.</p>
    <h6>OBJECTIVE</h6>
    <p>Our objective with the heuristic evaluation was to pinpoint the primary issues within the website and devise innovative solutions to address them, ultimately aiming to enhance the user experience. By focusing on key problem areas, we sought to implement changes that would not only resolve existing issues but also contribute to an overall improved and more user-friendly website. This approach aligns with our mission to create a digital platform that is intuitive, efficient, and a pleasure to navigate.</p>
